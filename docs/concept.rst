Concept & Ideas
===============

meteoglobal is:

 - a little device that allows users to record their local atmospheric
   conditions
 - a community website allowing users to share this data
 - a way to agglomerate and use all this data to have a clear representation
   of the current weather
 - a way to let users make their own forecast based from the community data
   and get ranks when their forecast proves itself accurate.
